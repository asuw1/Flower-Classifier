# Flower-Classifier
The project aimed to build on top of an existing pretrained CNN and tweak it to classify 102 flower types. I used DenseNet 121 but PyTorch offers a wide range of pretrained models to be used. I then added a classifier and trained the new network by freezing all parameters that come before the classififer. I managed to get an accuracy of over 80%.
