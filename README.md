# Flower-Classifier
My final project for the Udacity AI Programming with Python Nanodegree

The project aimed to build on top of an existing pretrained CNN and tweak it to classify 102 flower types. I used DenseNet 121 but PyTorch offers a wide range of pretrained models to be used. I then added a classifier and trained the new network by freezing all parameters that come before the classififer. I managed to get an accuracy of over 80%.
